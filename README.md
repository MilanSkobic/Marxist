Marxist
=======

Marxist allows websites to assemble themselves out of a host tiny 
json resources which are turned into page elements (requested, processed, updated and rendered into html)
inside of html5 Worker instances, and exposed to the containing document as 
entries in an instance of html5 Storage or an in-memory javascript object.
